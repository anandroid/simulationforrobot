**About this module**
----
This module is a simaulator for an agent in a fully observed environment with obstacles and a goal location. It also contains simulation for bluetooth low energy beacons and triangulation using them. BLEs can be added to the environment and RSSI signal values can be measured on any point in the environment to localise the agent.
